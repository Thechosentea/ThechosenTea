  <h2 style="color: #013220; font-size: 2rem;">Why Our Chosen Teas: Crafted with Purpose, Rooted in Healing</h2>
  <p>While our teas may be more expensive than common store brands, every jar we create is a reflection of deep care, sacred purpose, and uncompromising quality — something mass production simply cannot replicate.</p>
  <p>Our blends are made with potent herbs sourced from across the globe — from the lush botanical regions of Nigeria and the West Indies to the ancient herb gardens of Asia and China. We hand-select each ingredient for its specific wellness benefits, choosing only the best that nature offers, all with one intention: your healing.</p>
  <p>This global quality and intentional craftsmanship do come at a higher cost — but they also deliver something no corner store brand can: authenticity, tradition, and heart.</p>
  <p>Our teas were born from a deeply personal journey. After experiencing postpartum preeclampsia and high blood pressure, I began seeking natural ways to support my own healing. My daughter battles kidney challenges, and many of my family members live with silent health issues that affect them daily. This path led me to herbs — to their power, their history, and their ability to support body and soul.</p>
  <p>Each jar is more than tea. It’s an offering. It’s infused with positive affirmations, prayers, and love. It’s a soul-nourishing experience, designed to support your wellness journey from the inside out.</p>
  <p>The crown and Black Panther in our brand are more than symbols — they represent strength, divine purpose, and a quiet, nurturing power. Delicate hands cradle this mission with grace, while the spirit of a queen guides our intention.</p>
  <p>When you choose our teas, you’re not just making a purchase. You’re investing in your own wellness. You’re supporting a passionate, local business built on legacy, intention, and love. You’re joining a community that values holistic healing, ancestral wisdom, and a return to nature’s gifts.</p>
  <p><strong>This is tea — reimagined with reverence.</strong></p>

  <h2 style="color: #013220; font-size: 2rem;">Infused with Affirmation</h2>
  <p>Each jar of The Chosen Tea is more than a blend — it’s a sacred ritual. We include carefully selected positive affirmations and blessings with every tea order, creating a spiritual and emotional support layer to your wellness journey.</p>
  <p>Here are a few affirmations you may find included in your order:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>“My body is healing with every sip I take.”</li>
    <li>“I am grounded, peaceful, and whole.”</li>
    <li>“Every herb in this tea was created to support my divine health.”</li>
    <li>“I honor the wisdom of my ancestors in my healing process.”</li>
    <li>“This tea carries light, love, and balance into my being.”</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Feel free to write your own affirmations and speak them aloud as you brew. Your healing is a journey — and your words matter.</p>
